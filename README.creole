== Introduction ==

This repository contains a small collection of tools I use on a day to day
basis that are too small or basic to warrant their own repository.

== Availability ==

These tools are available on [[https://gitlab.com/krayon/ratslap|GitLab]],
[[https://github.com/krayon/ratslap|GitHub]] and
[[https://bitbucket.org/krayonx/ratslap|BitBucket]] with the primary repository
being [[https://gitlab.com/krayon/ratslap|GitLab]].
